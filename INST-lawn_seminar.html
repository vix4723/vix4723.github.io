							<h3>Myers & Briggs' 16 Personality Types, My College Experience, and Myself</h3>
							<p>Not a long time ago, I decided to take the Myers and Briggs’ personality test. 
								Apparently, I am an INFJ. An INFJ is known to be as someone who is Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging. 
								Based on the description of this personality, people with this personality get influenced by their inner vision, 
								personal values, and a principled version of humanism. 
								According to the official 16 personalities website, INFJs may the rarest personality type among all 16 personality types, 
								but they certainly leave their mark on the world because they want to stand up and make a difference. 
								This kind of personality is known as the “advocate” or “idealist”. For advocate and idealist personalities, 
								success doesn’t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world. 
								Moreover, people with this personality type care about integrity, and they’re rarely satisfied until they’ve done what they 
								know to be right and with their rich inner lives and their deep, abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don’t always 
								fit in with those around them - they sometimes feel misunderstood or at odds with the world. Even though advocates may be introverted, 
								but they value deep, authentic relationships with others. </p>
							<p>I can confirm that all of these descriptions are completely true and accurate. 
								I do feel the need to leave a mark in every community I am involved with and I don’t see becoming the wealthiest woman 
								in the world as my only objective in life. I strongly believe that for me being successful is for changing the lives of 
								others in a positive way. At McIntire, I often felt that I was different from all of my classmates. They were obsessed 
								with getting the highest-paying jobs at Wall Street or getting into the big 4 consulting firms. For me though, I was 
								obsessed with finding my values, strengths, and professional industry that could make me happy and afford everything 
								I needed in life. One of my strongest philosophies is that the richest person on Earth is not the person who has the 
								most amount of money, but the most amount of freedom to work and develop his/her passion. </p>
							<h4>Based on the 16 personalities website, here is a list of my personality’s strengths and weaknesses and I must confirm that this list is very accurate as well.</h4>
							<p> <h5>Strengths:</h5>
							<ol>
								<li><b>Creative</b> -> embracing creative side, 
									always on the lookout for opportunities to 
									express themselves and think outside the box</li>
								<li><b>Insightful</b> -> Advocates strive to move beyond 
									superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. </li>
								<li><b>Principled</b> -> Advocates tend to have strong beliefs 
									and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. 
									When advocates talk about topics close to their heart, 
									their conviction and heartfelt idealism can inspire and 
									persuade even the sternest of skeptics</li>
								<li><b>Passionate</b> -> Advocates crave a sense of purpose in life.
									Rather than sticking to the status quo, they want to chase 
									after their ideals.</li>
								<li><b>Altruistic</b> -> People with this personality type aren't happy to 
									succeed at another person's expense.</li>
							</ol>
							</p>
							<p> <h5>Weaknesses:</h5>
								<ol>
									<li><b>Sensitive to Criticism</b></li>
									<li><b>Reluctant to Open Up</b> -> Advocates value honesty and authenticity, 
										but they’re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and 
										be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone 
										else with their issues.</li>
									<li><b>Perfectionist</b> -> Advocates might find it difficult to 
										appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships 
										if they’re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering 
										whether they should be looking for something better</li>
									<li><b>Prone to Burnout</b> -> People with this personality type can exhaust 
										themselves if they don’t balance their drive to help others with 
										necessary self-care and rest</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>
								Based on my personal life, I do think that people with my personality are rare. 
								In fact, many people may agree that INFJs are rare because they hold a unique 
								combination of personality traits that is not present in most people. 
								This personality is divergent and combines incompatible functions. 
								Furthermore, statistics show that INFJs are the rarest type and take up only 1-2% of 
								the population and based on my own experience I have met very few people that 
								I felt that they were “like me”. In fact, a lot of people have told me that they 
								have never met a person like me and most of the time they are in shock. 
								INFJs are social introverts, kind but can be moody, and decisive and indecisive 
								at the same time. However, their intelligence and love for research and learning 
								allow them to see a bigger picture, be confident, and motivate others all at once. 
								They don’t like showing off, nor do they need praise or see themselves above others. 
								They don’t like being in the limelight, yet there is a part of them that requires 
								recognition and acknowledgment. All of the previous statements fully describe 
								who I am and most of my college experience. I want to be recognized and acknowledged, 
								but I am still humble to truly believe that I am not the best one in the room.
							</p>
							<p>
								Something I have been wondering about is whether or not people can change their 
								personalities over time. Based on a study from UC Davis, there is a possibility 
								that the personality of a person can change through persistent intervention and 
								major life events. It is possible that a person who was born being an INTJ could 
								change its personality to be an ENTJ. In the hypothetical case that major life 
								events can change the personality of a person, does that mean that the personality 
								does not have any correlation with the success of an individual? I would like to 
								keep that question in mind and come back within a few years with a clear answer.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lastly, I would like to share how I think my personality affected my college 
								experience and the majors I chose.
							</p>
							<p>
								When I applied to UVA, I was 100% a pre-comm major. I wanted to apply to McIntire
								and pursue the Finance concentration. I know, I was going to follow the traditional 
								path for the Finance Bros. But realistically, I was following that path because 
								I was not confident at all what my strengths and weaknesses were. I did not know 
								who I was or what I wanted to do with my life after graduation. I was not confident 
								that I would be successful pursuing an engineering major or a philosophy major. 
								I started to take courses on different academic subjects, but they were difficult 
								for me because I was just getting adjusted to a new academic environment and, again, 
								I was very insecure with myself. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Based on the description of my personality, it is true that I came to college to 
								find my purpose and what would truly make me happy in the future. I wanted to find 
								a purpose and try to avoid at all costs falling into the rat race in NYC or go to 
								the traditional consulting route that I know a lot of people were fighting for since 
								I was a first year. Everything changed when I took the introductory course CS1111, 
								I felt different. I actually enjoyed what I was doing and learning. I can’t really 
								describe that feeling with words, but I could see that I did not mind spending hours 
								with my classmates on that class or going to office hours. I found my purpose in 
								this academic subject and I strived to go deeper into it and find new ways on how 
								I could win awards and recognitions related to computer science. I’ve never felt 
								exhausted, but motivated to see all of the exciting opportunities that computer science 
								would give me in the short and long run. Then, I guess the rest is history based on 
								everything that I have learned and accomplished throughout these four years. Right now, 
								as I am writing this, I am scared of my future, I am not going to lie. 
								However, if there is something I would like to guarantee is that in anything I decide 
								to pursue or commit in the future, I’ll try my very best and strive to leave my mark 
								on this world. It would be cool for people to remember my name, to remember “Vix Clotet”.
